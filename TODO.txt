Bugs:
Attempting to run call then VDJtools (without denoise/EEfilter steps) leads to a crash because makeVDJtools expects its
input to include counts (derepcount style).  Need to do a check for this, and trigger a count if it isn't there.

To add:
Add options to supply gapopen, gapextend, penalty, etc. settings to blastn.

Add function to call a single gene, rather than running the whole pipeline (this will be good for testing, and also 
for finding new alleles.
